          Design
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Contrast:</b> Looks clean and easy to read. The blue links are
              not hindered by the blue accents of the page due to the
              underlining with CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Repetition:</b> CSS styling is consistent throughout the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Alignment:</b> Page elements are aligned well and cleanly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Proximity:</b> Nothing feels out of place and spacing is clean
              and readable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Links
          <ul>
            <li>Link from course page works correctly.</li>
            <li>
              Links to each of the sub pages work correctly in each direction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Elements and Requirements
          <ul>
            <li>Page contains header, footer, and main.</li>
            <li>Correctly has index.html as home page.</li>
            <li>Page has a title.</li>
            <li>
              Page has multiple functional pages that all work correctly and
              coincide well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigation to other pages works correctly and has consistent
              visuals.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Notes
          <ul>
            <li>All around amazing page. My only notes are very minor.</li>
            <li>
              On the photos page, there could be a bit more space between each
              picture—the captions make the elements feel slightly too close
              together.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the estimate page, consider changing the background for the
              "Typical Pricing" section to better contrast with the "Service"
              and "Notes" sections.
            </li>
            <li>All around amazing job.</li>
          </ul>
