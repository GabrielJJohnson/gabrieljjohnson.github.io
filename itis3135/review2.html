                    <li>
                        <b>Contrast:</b> Looks clean and easy to read.  The blue links are not hindered by the blue accents of the page due to the underlining with css
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Repetition:</b> CSS styling is consistent throughout the page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alignment:</b> Page elements are aligned well and cleanly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Proximity:</b> Nothing feels out of place and spacing is clean and readable
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Links</li>

                        Link from course page works correctly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Links to each of the sub pages work correctly in each direction
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Page contains header, footer, and main
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Correctly has index.html as home page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Page has a title
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Page has multiple functional pages that all work correctly and coincide well
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Navigation to other pages works correctly and has consistent visuals
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Notes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All around amazing page.  My only notes are very minor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the photos page, I think there could be a small amount more space added between each picture.  With the captions for each it feels like each element is <b>slightly</b> too close together
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the estimate page, I would see if there was a way to change the background for the "Typical Pricing" section in order to contrast between the "Service" and "Notes" sections.

                    <li>
                        All around amazing job
                    </li>
