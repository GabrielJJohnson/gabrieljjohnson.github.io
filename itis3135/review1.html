        Unfortunately upon my last check of Noah's webpage, there is no
        indication that his project has been completed. Because of this, I am
        unable to review his project webpage.

        As for recommendations, my main feedback is that if the project is
        complete, it should be easily accessible, as I could not take note of
        its existence.
