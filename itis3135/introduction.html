        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background : </b> I was born in Lincolnton, NC, in 2004.  I have always been big on technology and have always found it interesting, even when I do not understand how it works, which is much more often than I would like it to be</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background : </b>I have worked several jobs, most in either food or retail services.  I currently work as a line cook at a pizza place in uptown, but have also worked at a restaurant local to my hometown, waiting tables, and a cookout.  Aside from those I have worked in the library on campus, as a merchandiser for SunDrop, and as a mover.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background : </b>I am a junior studying Computer Science and Religious Studies, and I am hoping to get into the early masters program so I can complete the most amount of school in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer : </b>I have an HP, Windows 11, Laptop, my apartment</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why : </b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3688 - Computers and their Impact on Society: </b>Ultimately this course I am specifically taking because it is required, but I also enjoy learning about what makes people do what they do, along with how advancements in technology may affect someoneâ€™s actions.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3160 - Database Design and Implementation : </b> Although most of my courses are required, I am excited to take most of them for the sake of learning what I really want to allocate into for my career, this is one of those classes.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Front End Web Development: </b>I have always heard this course specifically is fun from all of my friends who have taken it before me, so I am excited to have a course I may truly enjoy aside from needing to complete and learn it.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3146 - Operating Systems and Networking: </b>As much as I use and love technology, there is much more to learn and hopefully this course will help me understand some of the how, not just the what, of using computers in general.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering: </b>Software Engineering is one of the fields most people in the general Computer Science field look at as one of the base line jobs, so I think learning as much about it as I can will only help me.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by: </b> I have 250 days logged on to Destiny 2</li>
        </ul>
